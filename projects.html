				<h2>Queue Up</h2>
				<p>
				This project was completed by my team during a hackathon. The web app could be used to keep track of customers
				in a public building, to avoid crowding in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. You can take a look at the Devpost
				link for media and for a more detailed explanation.

				<h2>Aaron Engine</h2>
				<p>
				I experimented by writing a game engine / framework from the ground up using C++ and OpenGL. It is by no means complete, but it provides basic functionality like loading 2d and 3d objects. I acquired all of the computer graphics knowledge through the internet, very interesting! I even created the models myself in Blender.

				<h2>Tim Game</h2>
				<p>
					I had a lot of fun making this one. As a team of 3, we made our friend a game for his birthday. I'm proud
					of this one because it was a more complete and polished project with music, art, programming, and design, all brought together to make a beautiful little game that everyone enjoyed.

			<div>
				<h2>Wake On Lan Redirect</h2>
				<p>
				Even though this was one of my earlier and less complex projects, I can still think back on it and feel accomplished.
				This really was my first real project. I had a problem that I couldn't find the solution to, so I created the solution,
				and learned so much in the process. To provide a brief explanation, I simply wanted to turn my pc on remotely, but my modem would keep forgetting
				my pc when it was off, so I used an spare android phone to wait for the WakeOnLan signal and broadcast it.

				<h2>Rubiks Cube</h2>
				<p>
				These were projects that I worked on with a friend. We challenged ourselves to create a rubik's cube simulation in C++/OpenGL, and again in Unity3D.
